      <h2>BACKGROUND</h2>
      <h4>
        In this project, we designed an interactive interface using Figma for a startup called <a href="https://www.pursuitoutside.com">Pursuit</a>. To design an interactive interface, we went through the full process of mocking up a solution to the startup's concept including sketching ideas of the interface, creating an interactive, high-fidelity prototype, conducting user testing on a final, revising prototype, and contacting the start up. These processes can be seen below.

  <h2 class="center-header">Sketching and Wireframing</h2>
  <h4><strong> Sketching </strong></h4>
  <h4>
    We first started off by sitting down for 10 minutes and each developing our own set of sketches for how we imagine the app to look like. In these sketches, we designed interfaces such as the home screen, browsing for experiences or bookings, a screen for an individual experience or booking, help page, etc. in different design settings. It was very interesting to see the variety of design ideas our group came up with!

  <h4>When developing our hi-fi prototype, our group members sometimes had disagreements on certain design elements such as the button styles, colors, and interactions. This truly showed me the difference between lo-fi and hi-fi prototypes and the purpose of each type of prototyping.</h4>

  <h4>We presented our hi-fi prototype to some other students and received critiques on the design and interactions of our prototype. from these critiques, we discovered various usability concerns that we had not noticed when we were working on it alone before. From this, I learned that it is important to receive outside feedback on design projects to ensure functionality and usability for all. </h4>

<!-- USER TESTING + ANALYSIS OF RESULTS -->

      <h2>User Testing & Analysis of Results</h2>

      <h4><b>Creating the User Test:</b> With our newly redesigned mockup, we then tasked three test agents with using the Pursuit prototype to browse available guided outdoor experiences before booking a specific experience. </h4>
      
      <p>Test agents were given the following context before they began using the prototpe: </p>
      <p id="test-instructions">Pursuit is a marketplace for finding and booking outdoor lodging and guided experiences. Imagine you are looking to book a guided outdoor experience using the Pursuit mobile app.
        <br>
        Note that you will be interacting with a mockup made through prototyping software, rather than an actual mobile app. Not all buttons are clickable and input fields are not interactive. However, everything you need to complete the specified task has been built and can be reached by navigating through the app.
        <br>
        Please think out loud as you perform the specified task.
      </p>

      <p>Then, test agents were given the following tasks:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>From the landing page, in your own words, what do you think you can do using this app?</li>
        <li>Browse the available guided outdoor experiences.</li>
        <li>Book the Catskills mountain hike.</li>
        <li>After completing the booking, review the details of your Catskills mountain hike booking.</li>
        <li>Try navigating back to the home page at some point while performing the tasks.</li>
      </ol>
      <p>For tasks 2-5, test agents were prompted to answer whether they were succesful at the task (Yes/No) and to rate the difficulty of the task (on a five-point scale from very difficult to very easy).</p>
      <p>They were then asked the following questions:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>How easy or difficult was it for you to complete the specified tasks?</li>
        <li>What were points of confusion for you while using the app, if any?</li>
        <li>Describe your experience navigating between pages on the app.</li>
        <li>Please feel free to share any other feedback you have regarding the app, including likes and dislikes.</li>
      </ul>
      <br>

      <h4><b>Results & Analsysis:</b> We received the results of our user testing, which indicated that test agents were able to succesfully complete all tasks but also highlighted areas for improvement. </h4>
      <p>Videos of agents completing our test can be accessed at the following links: 
        <a href="https://app.usertesting.com/v/3f2f1566-0340-4b37-942d-293ba9b2d980?encrypted_video_handle=a35ae474-a1b3-4985-a782-4adfb1a909f5#!/notes&shared_via=link">User 1</a>,

        GIFs of selected portions of the user testing are included below:</p>
      <div id="gif-holder">
        <div><img class="gif" src="iterative-design/user1.gif"></div>
        <div><img class="gif" src="iterative-design/user2.gif"></div>
        <div><img class="gif" src="iterative-design/user3.gif"></div>
      </div>

      <p>From reviewing the user testing sessions, we obtained the following takeaways:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><b>All users successfully completed the overarching task</b> of browsing outdoor experiences and then booking the Catskills mountain hike with ease. Referring to the numbered tasks above, the success rate for 2 and 3 was 100% with all testers rating the task as "Very Easy".</li>
        <li><b>Users understood the back arrow and home button navigation well</b> (with 100% success on task 5 and all testers rating it "Very Easy").</li>
        <li><b>Each tester misunderstood the bottom navigation bar,</b> with general confusion on the meanings of the icons. For example, one user interpreted the tent icon as a button for booking experiences, when in reality, it is for booking lodging.</li>
        <li>While working on task 4, one user was frustrated that there was no page for reviewing already-booked lodging and experiences.</li>
        <li>Testers <b>appreciated the visual design of the app</b>, particularly the large photos, but some desired additional photos for each experience.</li>
      </ul>
      <p><b>Next Steps: </b>We were happy to see user success on the given tasks! We were surprised by the confusion on the bottom navigation bar but grateful to have identified areas for improvement from the user testing. If we were to iterate on our designs once more, we would:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Choose <b>more clear icons for the bottom navigation bar</b> as well as include text describing what each icon navigates to</li>
        <li>Add in a <b>page for viewing already-booked lodging and experiences</b></li>
        <li><b>Add more photos</b> for each experience</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Summary & Takeaways</h2>
      <h4> In this project, we went through a full design process and iterated on our design based on various feedback. During this process, we learned:</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>When working on designs in groups, team members may have different opinions on design choices. It is important to ensure that all team members are on the same page when working on the design.</li>
        <li> User testing and feedback is important! Through critiques and user testing, we discovered places our design could be improved that we had not noticed before. </li>
        <li> Designing for mobile applications requires greater consideration of things such as accessibility as well as larger font and button tap sizes to improve usability.</li>
